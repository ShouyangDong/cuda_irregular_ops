def smt_transform(code, loop_index, factor):
    """
    Transform C code using an SMT solver to optimize loop constructs.

    This function parses the provided C code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and applies
    a transformation to split loops based on the given loop index and factor. The transformation
    is guided by an SMT solver to ensure the generated code is logically equivalent to the
    original but potentially more optimized.

    Parameters:
    - code (str): A string containing the C code to be transformed.
    - loop_index (str): The index of the loop to be split in the AST.
    - factor (int): The factor by which the loop is to be split.

    Returns:
    - str: The transformed C code as a string.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the loop index is out of bounds or the factor is not valid.

    Todo:
    - Implement additional error checking for the input parameters.
    - Extend the visitor to handle more complex loop structures.

def transform_block(code, user_mannual):
    """
    Apply a series of transformations to the input code based on user manual instructions.

    This function first transforms the code using an AI model (presumably 'gpt') that
    understands the user manual instructions. It then tests the transformed code with a
    unittest to check for any issues. If the unittest indicates a failure, the code
    is further refined using a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to fix any
    potential problems.

    Parameters:
    - code (str): The original source code to be transformed.
    - user_mannual (str): Instructions provided by the user to guide the transformation.

    Returns:
    - str: The transformed and potentially fixed source code.

    Raises:
    - NotImplementedError: If any of the transformation functions are not implemented.

    Todo:
    - Add error handling for cases where transformation or testing fails.
    - Improve the unittest to cover more edge cases.
